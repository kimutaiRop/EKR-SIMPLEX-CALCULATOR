# EKR-SIMPLEX-CALCULATOR

this is python version of the program, if you prefer julia you can find a copy of julia from
https://github.com/kimutaiRop/JULIA_EKR_SIMPLEX_PROBLE_CALCULATOR

the julia version is also linked to a web server which is available for download at https://github.com/kimutaiRop/statis
which has a web iterface at https://statis.herokuapp.com/simplex

This is a simplex problem calculator for statistics

problems it solves:
  1. maximization
  2. minimization
 
you can use this to draw tables
you need to install
numpy to use this program


data values supported can be in the following forms:
  1. fractions. eg. (2/3)
  2. decimal numbers. eg. 0.5
  3. whole numbers. eg. 100
  
I allowed definition of number of decimals to be used in solution
  
I also added notification for those problems that dont possibly have solution due to wrong formulation of constrains and its values.

clone or download then run:

to install basic requirements

`pip install numpy`

`pip install pandas`

finally you can run the program by running

`python3 simplex.py`

only console usage of the program is available yet

The simplex tableaus are drawn in form of python lists or pandas tables.

live demo is available in youtube if you happen to visit the please subscribe.. I appreciate https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vZRUVN1EQU
